 * Name: up_stack_frame
 *
 * Description:
 *   Allocate a stack frame in the TCB's stack to hold thread-specific data.
 *   This function may be called anytime after up_create_stack() or
 *   up_use_stack() have been called but before the task has been started.
 *
 *   Thread data may be kept in the stack (instead of in the TCB) if it is
 *   accessed by the user code directly.  This includes such things as
 *   argv[].  The stack memory is guaranteed to be in the same protection
 *   domain as the thread.
 *
 *   The following TCB fields will be re-initialized:
 *
 *   - adj_stack_size: Stack size after removal of the stack frame from
 *     the stack
 *   - stack_base_ptr: Adjusted stack base pointer after the TLS Data and
 *     Arguments has been removed from the stack allocation.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   - tcb:  The TCB of new task
 *   - frame_size:  The size of the stack frame to allocate.
 *
 *  Returned Value:
 *   - A pointer to bottom of the allocated stack frame.  NULL will be
 *     returned on any failures.  The alignment of the returned value is
 *     the same as the alignment of the stack itself.
